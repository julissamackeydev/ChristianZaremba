<p class="flow-text">The American/French bass Christian Zaremba is quickly garnering a reputation in the eyes of critics and directors alike, as a flexible and multifaceted artist comfortable portraying a wide range of characters; from lovers, to loafers, and to lords with a voice to match.<br>Praised by the New York Times as "a stage animal with a big bass voice" Christian returned in 2016 to Wolf Trap Opera singing Collatinus in The Rape of Lucretia and Passagallo in Gassman's L'Opera Seria.  In the 2016-17 season Christian returns to Opera Omaha to sing Colline in La Boheme and will make his Portland Opera debut in the same role.  Also in Portland, he will reprise his role as the Bass Soloist in Lang's The Little Matchgirl Passion and sing Andrew in The Difficulty of Crossing a Field.<br>The 2017-18 season sees Mr. Zaremba make his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on New Year's Eve as Angelotti in Tosca.  He will also make debuts with Austin Opera as Zuniga in Carmen and as Sparafucile in Rigoletto  with Michigan Opera Theater.<br>His came to this noble art of opera in a slightly different way and at a later age than most.  In hindsight the journey began when I was 5 years old and my grandmother and mother pooled their savings to begin my first violin lessons.  Over the next 10 years I was  introduced to a world so very different and expansive in expression from the one I was leading in reality.<br>I had begun studying martial arts at a young age until midway through high school, I was practicing capoeira, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Boxing, and wrestling and even took home a bronze in the East coast submission grappling championship.<br>Through a twist of fate I ended up studying Sociology and Theatre at New York University.  After spending some time abroad in conjunction with Humboldt Universitet in Berlin, Germany I discovered opera.  Upon graduation I immediately took a job as a personal trainer and maintained a private clientele, until, by chance I took an audition with the Metropolitan Opera for an opera called Il Trovatore directed by Sir David McVicar.<br>That particular production was searching for actors who could read music, perform stage combat, and wouldn't mind being onstage without a shirt!  Over the next four years I was fortunate enough to be asked to fight onstage in almost 1000 performances at the Met:  From being the fight captain in an epic production of Boris Godunov, to rappelling down a high prison wall in Tosca, to playing the silent vision of Placido Domingo's father in Iphigenie en Tauride!!<br>It was there, that I was fortunate enough to meet my teacher, the venerable American bass Peter Volpe, who taught me generously in return for my work on his farm.  Through these journeys I was introduced to this great art and the privilege of learning to become an opera singer and artist.</p>
